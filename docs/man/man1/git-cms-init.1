.TH GIT_CMS_INIT 1 LOCAL

.SH NAME

git-cms-init - CMSSW helper to initialize git repository with remotes in working area.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B git cms-init [options] [release] 

.SH DESCRIPTION

This command is equivalent to 'git init' or 'git clone', but
customized for the CMSSW use case.
It initializes the git repository in the src/ folder of the CMSSW working
area, with remotes configured: official-cmssw (upstream) and my-cmssw
(origin, your personal fork).
By default, the current release specified by the environment variable
$CMSSW_BASE is used. An alternative release can be specified as the last argument.
This command may be called by other commands such as cms-addpkg.

To use a specified protocol (https, ssh, or mixed (default))
always rather than specifying the flag each time, the git config can be used:

git config --global cms.protocol ssh
